What happens to the layout whenyou resize the screen to less than 550px.

If the website is designed with media queries the layout of the website changes. Typically so that website content can fit on screen without having to navigate left and right(scalable grid).

How do you think that works 

Media queries work from small to large to prevent unnecessary css loading on smaller devices/browsers. Browsers will determine the size of the browser which will vary from device to device and load css according to min-width:.
